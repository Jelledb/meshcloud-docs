# PaaS Functions in Meshpanel

The Meshpanel offers the industry-standard cloud platform Cloud Foundry as PaaS.

## Application Containers

Containers provide your applications with an isolated runtime environment, separating them from the underlying infrastructure. Your containerized software always will run the same, independent from the environment, even if different software is run on the same infrastructure.

## Services

Services on our PaaS offering enable application developers to easily bind their applications to Databases, Document Stores, Queuing and other backend Services.

## Private Domains

In order to use a own route for deployed apps inside Cloud Foundry each customer can add his own private domains to his account.
