# Meshcloud Project Management

## What is a Meshproject?

In order to use cloud computing resources, you have to create a Meshproject. Within the Meshproject, you can manage and scale the resources you use across all locations.

## Create a new Meshproject

Log on to the Meshpanel with your account credentials and press "Create". Type in a name for your new project and press "Next". Choose a payment method as well as your billing address and press "Next" again. In the last step, you can choose up to two locations from which you can obtain the cloud computing resources for your project. Press "Create Project" and you will see your new project listed in the Projects List.
