# Object Storage

Object Storage enables application developers to store data as objects. It's efficient and safe as it is highly available and distributed. Each object is replicated 3 times and distributed on to different servers. With our Object Storage you can create containers and store BLOBS \(Binary Large OBjects\), such as images, audio or multimedia objects.
