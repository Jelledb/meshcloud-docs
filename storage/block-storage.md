# Block Storage

Create storage volumes of any size that are independent from the life cycle of your instances. Connect them flexibly with instances. The security of your data is of great importance to us and that is why they are exclusively stored in Germany. We replicate each of your volumes three times. Additionally, you are granted the possibility to create snapshots and store them in a different location at any point in time. Our blockstorage service is based on OpenStack Cinder.
