# Meshcloud Service Users

Sometimes you may need a special user with separate credentials for automated deployment tasks. This is what Meshcloud Service users are made for. A service user has to be created for a specific platform \(compute, container\) within a specific project. You can have multiple Service Users per platform and project.
