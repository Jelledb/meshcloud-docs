Administrators can inform users about platform specific events by creating platform notifications:

- **Platforms**: Select the platforms relevant to your notification so they can be shown on the affected platform's dashboards. Users can also [subscribe](meshcloud.profile.md#profile) to notifications by platform and will receive new notifications via email.
- **Message**: The message that will be shown to all users.
- **Severity**: The type of message (info, warning, critical).
- **Show From**: The earliest time the message will be shown. You can use this to create messages that will only be shown on at a later date.
- **Show Until**: After this time the message will no longer be displayed.
