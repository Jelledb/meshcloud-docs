## Delete User
If you also want to delete a user, follow these additional steps:

5. A popup shows up where you have to enter the username or email address of the user you want to delete. This makes sure, that no user is deleted accidentally.
6. Click **"Confirm Deletion"** to finally delete the user. The user will be removed from all projects and customers he is assigned to automatically. The user will only be flagged as deleted and everything but his username will be pseudonomized via a SHA-256 hash.
