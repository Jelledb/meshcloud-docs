To give you a better overview on what you are capable to do with your services, we created Service Dashboards. From the Service Dashboards you are able to [create Backup Routines ](/paas/services/backup.md)for your services or to create Service Keys for your services.

## Accessing your Service Dashboard

1. [Login to your Cloud Foundry CLI ](/paas/cloud-foundry-cli-access.md)

2. See a list of your services with `cf services`. If you do not have any services yet, get started by [Creating a Service](/paas/services/creating-a-service.md)

3. With `cf service yourServiceName` you get to see more details on your existing services

4. Copy the URL shown under Dashboard to your browser

5. Congratulations. You accessed your Service Dashboard
