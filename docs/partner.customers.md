## Creating Customer Accounts

With Meshcloud you can easily create customer accounts. The Meshcloud partner area is the place to create and manage your customer accounts. You can access the Meshcloud "Partner Area" by opening the settings menu and navigating to the "Partner Area". In case you do not see a menu entry called "Partner Area" in your settings menu, your account is probably not a partner account yet. Please contact [Meshcloud Support](https://support.meshcloud.io),  we are happy to transform your account at any time.

1. Login to the Meshpanel \([panel.meshcloud.io](https://panel.meshcloud.io)\) with your partner credentials
2. Navigate **Settings &gt; Partner Area** via the settings button on the top right or use this link:
   [https://panel.meshcloud.io/\#/partner](https://panel.meshcloud.io/#/partner)
3. Click on **"Customers"** on the left menu. In this area you can create new customers and manage
   your customersâ€™ project quotas and assigned users.
4. On the top just enter the customer and your identifier (which is usually the same, but please be aware that you can not change the identifier later on). Then click on the `+` button. Your new customer is created.
5. You will probably need access to this account in order to assign user to it so you first must give yourself access to this newly created account. Click on the *Customer Users* button on the customer row in the table.
6. On the next page click on the `Add Myself` button to assign yourself to the account.
7. After this was successful you can change into the account by clicking on the top left dropdown and select your newly created customer name in order to provide access to it or to create projects. Please see the next section for details.

## Providing access to the customer account

1. Create a project for your customer from the project dashboard.
2. Navigate to Users in your Account Settings or use this link:
    [https://panel.meshcloud.io/\#/customer/users](https://panel.meshcloud.io/#/customer/users)
3. Add new users to the customer. They will receive an invitation via e-mail.
4. As a customer admin you have to provide users access to the project for which they should manage the resources.
5. Navigate to **Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Projects** and provide access to the project.

You will soon be able to change the User Role to Customer Admin.
