<h3 style="margin-top: 0">Welcome to the meshStack Documentation!</h3>

meshStack is the name of our technology that powers the meshcloud solution. This document is targeted at cloud architects and SREs and introduces the components of meshStack and their interaction.

It is a modular software platform solution that connects organizational processes like project and access management with cloud technology. It provides a unified administration interface to the organization while replicating configuration into attached cloud platforms.

It is NOT a meta-layer across clouds. Users access native cloud APIs for their deployments, but meshStack helps them to ensure a proper and common configuration across cloud technologies with additional functionality such as metering, billing, surveillance and others.
