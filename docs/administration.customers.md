With a Partner Account you can easily manage multiple customer accounts with the Meshcloud Portal. The Meshcloud administration area is the place to create and manage your customer accounts. You can access the Meshcloud **Administration** Area by opening the settings menu and navigating to the **Administration** Area. In case you do not see a menu entry called **Administration** in your settings menu, your account is probably not a partner account yet. Please contact [Meshcloud Support](https://support.meshcloud.io), we are happy to transform your account at any time.

When selecting **Customers** in the menu bar on the left you can see the list of all customers managed by you.
