## Managing Project Quotas

The **Administration** Area includes a quota dashboard that lets you define the amount of resources your customers can use for their projects. These resource definitions are called quotas. Quotas can be set per customer project. OpenStack and Cloud Foundry quotas are defined independently.

To edit the quotas, please follow these steps:

1. Login to the Meshpanel with your Administrator credentials.
2. Navigate to the **Administration** via the settings button on the top right.
3. Click on **Customers**. In this area you can create new customers and manage your customersâ€™ quotas. You will see a list of your customers here.
4. Under the **Actions** column, you can click on **Customer Projects** and you will see a list of all the projects belonging to that customer.
5. Also under the **Actions** column, you reach the **Quota Dashboard**. These quotas are project-specific.
6. You can now change the quotas as desired.

## Project Export

If you need to get an overview of all projects or want to use them inside a spreadsheed application you can export all projects as a
[.csv file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values). This export contains one row for each Platform that is configured for a project. The configured billing adresses, project tags, local IDs of the project in the cloud platforms and more is available in this export.

To export projects, plase follow these steps:

1. Login to the Meshpanel with your Administrator credentials.
2. Navigate to the **Administration** Area via the settings button on the top right.
3. Click on **Customers**.
4. In the upper right there is the button `Project Export`. By clicking it, the download of the Project .CSV file for all customers will start.

## Quota Export

This export is an extension of the [Project Export](#project-export). It adds the configured Project Quota to the export. The `Quota Export` button is available in the upper right of **Customers** section in the **Administration** Area as well.

## Delete Projects

When a user deletes a meshProject it is not completely removed in the cloud platforms and in the database, but first only flagged for deletion. An asynchronous background job removes tenants from platforms regularly. Partners and Admins can find a list of **Deleted Projects** in the **Projects** section of the **Administration** Area. This list allows Cloud Admins to check for projects that have been deleted. The "Deleted in platforms on" column shows when the background process that actually deletes the "marked for deletion" projects in the platforms has been executed successfully.

## Project History

Sometimes it might be necessary to get additional information about the lifecycle of the project. The archive icon in the list of deleted projects shows all major events that have happened on the project. This history is also available for existing projects in the **Customers** section of the **Administration** area. Navigate to the **Customer Projects** of a specific customer and click the archive icon on the project you want to get details about.
