Within the Meshcloud platform we differentiate the following roles.

## Meshcloud Partners \(Support Partners\)

Meshcloud Partners have the ability to manage multiple Meshcloud Customer accounts within the Meshcloud platform. Therefore, a Meshcloud Partner account has additional functionality to enable customer management.

## Customer Admin

Customers can create multiple projects and can have multiple customer employees \(users\) belonging to one company or one department. A customer admin can add users to a project via e-mail invite. 

As a Customer Admin you can:

* Create projects on the platform
* Create users for your account
* Grant users access to specific projects
* Remove user access from specific projects
* Edit the company information of your account \(Company Address, Billing Address, Payment Method\)

## Users

Users are generally customer employees. They have to be granted access to a project by the Customer Admin. They can manage resources within the projects that they have been granted access to.

As a User you can:

* Create and delete resources within the projects that you have been granted access to by a customer admin
