# Deploying a Heat Stack

Heat templates are used to orchestrate infrastructure, also known as infrastructure as code.  This enables you to create a template for your infrastructure, which describes different resource types and their relationships and which can be \(re-\)run at any time. Using Heat you are able to automate and standardize your deployments and make them less prone to errors.
