# Object Storage

Object Storage enables application developers to store data as objects. It's efficient and safe as it is highly available and distributed. Each object is replicated 3 times and distributed on to different servers. With our Object Storage you can create containers and store BLOBS \(Binary Large OBjects\), such as images, audio or multimedia objects.

If you would like to display information for your account, an object or a container, type:

```
$ swift stat
$ swift stat ACCOUNT
$ swift stat CONTAINER
$ swift stat OBJECT
```

For listing containers, type:

```
$ swift list
```
