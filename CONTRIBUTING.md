# Style Guide for Meshcloud Documentation

## Language

* Primary documentation language is **English**.
* The tone is practical without personal opinions, viewpoints, rants etc. â€“ it's a sober technical documentation.
* Write short, but precise sentences. Make sure you give complete information and to reveal implicit conclusions or implications which might not be obvious to a fresh reader ("We can't read your mind, only your text").
* Do not bloat your texts by getting anecdotic, stating too many details or providing too many alternatives to reach a certain goal.
* Use paragraphs and sub headings in a meaningful way to structure your text for quick scanning.

## Formatting

The following formatting should be applied for contribution to the Meshcloud documentation.

* Navigation Items: When you name navigation items such as menu labels put them in **bold**. For buttons use backticks (\`). No quotation marks around item names (") please.
