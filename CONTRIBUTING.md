## Audience Personas

Meshcloud offers different functionality to people with different roles. To make documentation clearer, we introduce different *audience personas* which helps to direct a feature or description to a defined target role. Authors of documentation or Release Notes should tailor their descriptions using these roles to communicate efficiently.

* **User**  
Someone who uses the meshcloud panel to consume the meshcloud functionality, usually a developer or DevOps engineer. Users are focused on delivering value with their application deployments and use meshcloud to efficiently access, automate and administer the cloud technology they want to use. They want quick access to their deployment spaces and the resources they need. This means avoiding lenghty processes as much as possible, self-service and straight-through processing is key.

## Style Guide for Meshcloud Documentation

### Language

* Primary documentation language is **English**.
* The tone is practical without personal opinions, viewpoints, rants etc. â€“ it's a sober technical documentation.
* Write short, but precise sentences. Make sure you give complete information and to reveal implicit conclusions or implications which might not be obvious to a fresh reader ("We can't read your mind, only your text").
* Do not bloat your texts by getting anecdotic, stating too many details or providing too many alternatives to reach a certain goal.
* Use paragraphs and sub headings in a meaningful way to structure your text for quick scanning.

### Formatting

The following formatting should be applied for contribution to the Meshcloud documentation.

* Navigation Items: When you name navigation items such as **menu labels** put them in double-star **bold** (\*\*menu-label\*\*) .
* For `buttons` use backticks (\`button\`).
* No quotation marks around item names (") please.
* Use the style as recommended by [markdownlint](https://github.com/markdownlint/markdownlint). For VSCode use the extensions `davidanson.vscode-markdownlint` to get inline linting.
