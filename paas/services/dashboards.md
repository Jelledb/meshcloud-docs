# Dashboards

To give you a better overview on what you are capable to do with your services, we created Service Dashboards. From the Service Dashboards you are able to [create Backup Routines](https://meshcloud.gitbooks.io/meshcloud/content/paas/services/backup.html) for your services or to create Service Keys for your services.

## Accessing your Service Dashboard

1. [Login to your Cloud Foundry CLI ](https://meshcloud.gitbooks.io/meshcloud/content/paas/cloud-foundry-cli-access.html)

2. See a list of your services with \`cf services\`. If you do not have any services yet, get started by [creating a service](https://meshcloud.gitbooks.io/meshcloud/content/paas/services/binding-a-service-to-your-application.html)

3. With \`cf service yourServiceName\` you get to see more details on your existing services

4. Copy the URL shown under Dashboard to your browser 

5. Congratulations. You accessed your Service Dashboard
