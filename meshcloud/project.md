# Meshcloud Project Management

## What is a Meshproject?

In order to use cloud computing resources, you have to create a Meshproject. Within the Meshproject, you can manage and scale the resources you use across all locations.

## Create a new Meshproject

Log on to the Meshpanel with your account credentials and press "Create". Type in a name for your new project and press "Next". Choose a payment method as well as your billing address and press "Next" again. In the last step, you can choose the locations from which you can obtain the cloud computing resources for your project. Press "Create Project" and you will see your new project listed in the Projects List.

## Assign user to a Meshproject

Before being able to assign a user to a Meshproject, the user must have been [invited to the Meshcustomer](customer.md). Then go to your "Account" settings. You access them by pressing the settings icon on the top right of the panel. From here, navigate to "Projects" and click the pen button to edit the project. In the "Project Users" section you can start typing the email address of a user assigned to your Meshcustomer and select the according user in the dropdown. Press the "+" to actually add this user to the project. Note that only users with a valid account on the Meshpanel can access your projects.
