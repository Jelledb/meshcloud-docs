# Backup Services

For all data services like Database, Document Stores and other content related services we offer a basic Backup and Restore integration. For Services like MariaDB for example we rely on `mysqldump.`

We choose to take this approach to enable customers an easy integration with existing Backup and Restore methods they know from general interaction with their Database and Document Store.

## Availability

The Backup Feature is included in **all Services **independent of the level of Services.

_We may restrict this in future release depending on the load, but our Backup Features architecture enables a cloud-native scalability._

## Terminology
